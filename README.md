# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset using **MySQL** to extract meaningful business insights. The objective is to demonstrate core data analyst skills such as data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and professional reporting. The final insights are summarized in a project report and a presentation created using **Gamma**, making the project suitable for portfolio review and interview discussions.

## Dataset

* The dataset contains information related to pizza orders, order details, pizza types, sizes, and prices.
* It represents transactional sales data from a pizza business.
* The dataset was loaded into a MySQL database for structured querying and analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

* **MySQL** – Data storage, EDA, and SQL querying
* **SQL** – Data analysis and aggregation
* **Gamma** – Presentation (PPT) creation
* **PDF / Document Tools** – Project report documentation

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Created tables in MySQL.
   * Imported the pizza sales dataset into the MySQL database.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Examined table structures and relationships.
   * Checked record counts and key attributes.
   * Identified important variables such as revenue, quantity sold, category, and size.

3. **SQL Analysis**

   * Wrote SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions.
   * Answered key business questions related to sales, revenue, and customer demand.
   * Identified top-selling pizzas, best-performing categories, and size preferences.

4. **Reporting**

   * Converted SQL outputs into a structured data analysis report.
   * Highlighted key findings and business insights in a clear, professional format.

5. **Presentation**

   * Created a concise presentation using **Gamma**.
   * Summarized objectives, methodology, insights, and conclusions for easy stakeholder understanding.

## Results

* Identified total revenue and overall sales performance.
* Determined the most popular pizza sizes and categories.
* Highlighted top-performing and low-performing pizzas.
* Derived actionable insights to support menu optimization and sales strategy.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install and set up **MySQL** on your system.
2. Create a new database for the project.
3. Import the pizza sales dataset into MySQL tables.
4. Run the provided SQL queries to reproduce the analysis.
5. Review the generated outputs for insights.
6. Refer to the project report and Gamma presentation for summarized findings.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical SQL-based data analysis skills and the ability to translate raw data into business insights. It reflects real-world analytical thinking and clear communication, making it well-suited for data analyst interviews and portfolio presentations.
